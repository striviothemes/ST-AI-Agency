# ST AI Agency

**ST AI Agency** is a free Astro AI agency theme for AI agencies, AI automation studios, AI consultancies and AI agent platforms. It has a warm orange, cream and dark-brown design, a single-page homepage with a section for each topic, and a full Markdown blog. It ships almost no JavaScript.

> *AI agents that run the work, not the demo.*

## Demo

**Live demo:** [st-ai-agency.vercel.app](https://st-ai-agency.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Astro 7** with static output and no UI framework.
- **AI agency design.** A full-bleed hero that tints its photo in the brand colours, editorial service rows, a heat-gradient process band, dark customer cards and arched portraits.
- **Responsive layout** at every width, with a mobile menu below 1200px.
- **One homepage with a section for each topic.** Hero, client strip, AI solutions, platform/features, process, customer results, statistics, industry sectors, testimonial, team, pricing, insights preview, FAQ, contact form and a call-to-action band.
- **Blog** built on Astro Content Collections (Content Layer `glob` loader). Each post gets its own page with breadcrumbs, author, date, reading time, tags, previous/next links and related posts.
- **Blog index** with a featured post and a category filter. The filter is a progressive enhancement and the page works without JavaScript.
- **SEO.** Canonical URLs, Open Graph and Twitter/X cards, JSON-LD (`Organization`, `WebSite`, `BlogPosting`, `BreadcrumbList`), a sitemap, `robots.txt` and an RSS feed.
- **Accessibility**
  - Skip link and semantic landmarks.
  - Accessible mobile dialog: focus trap, Escape to close, focus returned to the menu button.
  - FAQ accordion with `aria-expanded`.
  - `aria-current` on real page links only.
  - Visible focus states.
  - Reduced-motion support.
  - Content stays fully readable with JavaScript disabled.
- **Lightweight JavaScript.** About 3 KB of minified vanilla JavaScript per page, inlined by Astro. No framework runtime and no third-party scripts.
- **Easy to customise.** One site config file plus typed data files for every homepage section.
- **Self-hosted fonts** (Outfit and Inter Tight) with no third-party font requests.
- **Optimised local images.** WebP files with explicit dimensions. The hero is preloaded and images further down the page are lazy-loaded.
- **Static form UI** that is honest about being a demo until you connect a provider (Formspree, Netlify Forms, Web3Forms or your own API).
- **Sub-path deploys.** Works at a domain root or under a sub-path, such as a GitHub Pages project site.

## Tech stack

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Astro](https://astro.build) 7 | Static site generator, components, content collections |
| [@astrojs/sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/) | Generates `sitemap-index.xml` |
| [@astrojs/rss](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/rss/) | Generates `rss.xml` for the blog |
| [@fontsource-variable/outfit](https://fontsource.org/fonts/outfit) & [inter-tight](https://fontsource.org/fonts/inter-tight) | Self-hosted variable fonts |
| TypeScript | Typed config, data and scripts |
| Plain CSS | Design tokens and component styles (no Tailwind) |
| Vanilla TypeScript | Header, mobile menu, reveal, FAQ, forms |

Dev-only: `@astrojs/check` and `typescript` for `npm run check`.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22.12.0 or newer.** This is the minimum for Astro 7. An `.nvmrc` file is included.
- npm 9.6.5 or newer, which ships with Node 22.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/striviothemes/ST-AI-Agency.git
cd ST-AI-Agency
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Opens at `http://localhost:4321`. If that port is already taken, Astro picks the next free one and prints it.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site is written to `dist/`.

## Preview

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the production build locally. Run `npm run check` for TypeScript and Astro diagnostics.

### Routes

The theme generates only these pages:

| Route | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | `src/pages/index.astro` |
| `/blog` | `src/pages/blog/index.astro` |
| `/blog/<slug>` | `src/pages/blog/[slug].astro` |
| `/404` | `src/pages/404.astro` |

It also generates `/rss.xml`, `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap-index.xml`. Solutions, features, pricing, customers, sectors, process, team, FAQ and contact are sections of the homepage, reached with anchors such as `/#pricing`.

## Customization

You only need to edit **`src/config/site.ts`**, **`src/data/*`** and **`src/styles/tokens.css`** for most changes.

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Site name, word-mark, tagline, description | `src/config/site.ts` → `name`, `brand`, `tagline`, `description` |
| Email, phone, address, response time | `src/config/site.ts` |
| Social links | `src/config/site.ts` → `social` (remove an entry to hide its icon) |
| SEO defaults, share image, theme colour | `src/config/site.ts` → `seo` |
| Main CTA ("Book a demo") | `src/config/site.ts` → `cta` |
| Copyright line | `src/config/site.ts` → `copyright` |
| Logo / monogram | `src/components/icons/Logo.astro` and `public/favicon.svg` |
| Header, mobile and footer navigation | `src/data/navigation.ts` |
| Hero copy, stats, client names, section headings, CTA band, newsletter | `src/data/home.ts` |
| Solutions (service rows) | `src/data/solutions.ts` |
| Platform features checklist | `src/data/features.ts` |
| Process steps | `src/data/process.ts` |
| Customer case studies | `src/data/customers.ts` |
| Big-number statistics | `src/data/stats.ts` |
| Sectors | `src/data/sectors.ts` |
| Testimonial | `src/data/testimonials.ts` |
| Team | `src/data/team.ts` (supports optional `bio` and `social`) |
| Pricing plans | `src/data/pricing.ts` |
| FAQ | `src/data/faq.ts` |
| Colours | `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--o900`…`--o100`, `--cream`, `--ink`, …) |
| Typography | `src/styles/tokens.css` (`--display`, `--body`) plus the font imports in `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` |
| Section order or removal | `src/pages/index.astro` (comment out or reorder components) |

Section titles can contain `<br>` for deliberate line breaks, for example `'Six weeks from<br>workshop to live.'`.

**Every name, company, figure and quote in the demo content is fictional.** Replace it with your own before you launch.

### Changing the colours

The palette is a ramp of oranges (`--o900` darkest to `--o100` lightest) plus neutrals. Change the hex values in `tokens.css` and the theme follows. A few hero gradients in `components.css` (`.hero__duo`, `.hero__warm`, `.hero__scrim`) use literal colour stops so they can be tuned separately. Edit those too if you move far away from orange.

### Changing the fonts

1. Install another Fontsource package, for example `npm i @fontsource-variable/manrope`.
2. Replace the imports at the top of `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`, including the two `?url` preload imports.
3. Update `--display` / `--body` in `tokens.css`.

## Adding blog posts

Create a Markdown file in `src/content/blog/`. The file name becomes the URL, so `my-new-post.md` is published at `/blog/my-new-post`.

```markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
description: One or two sentences for cards, meta description and social previews.
pubDate: 2026-10-01
updatedDate: 2026-10-08        # optional
category: Operations
author: Amara Boateng
authorRole: Founder, principal engineer   # optional
image: /images/blog-ai-agents.webp        # file in /public
imageAlt: Describe the image for screen readers
tags: [AI agents, Operations]
readingTime: 6                 # optional; calculated from word count if omitted
featured: false                # optional; pins the post as "Latest note" on /blog
draft: false                   # drafts show in `npm run dev` only
---

Your content in Markdown…
```

The frontmatter is validated by the schema in `src/content.config.ts`, so a typo fails the build with a clear message. The homepage Insights section shows the three newest posts automatically.

## Contact form

The contact and newsletter forms are plain HTML forms. While no endpoint is configured they run in **demo mode**: submitting sends nothing and shows a notice saying so. To connect a provider, edit `forms` in `src/config/site.ts`.

**Formspree:**

```ts
forms: { contactAction: 'https://formspree.io/f/<your-form-id>', newsletterAction: '', netlify: false }
```

**Web3Forms.** Set `contactAction: 'https://api.web3forms.com/submit'`, then add your access key as a hidden field inside the form in `src/components/ContactCTA.astro`:

```html
<input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_PUBLIC_ACCESS_KEY" />
```

**Netlify Forms:**

```ts
forms: { contactAction: '', newsletterAction: '', netlify: true }
```

With `netlify: true` the forms get `data-netlify="true"`, a hidden `form-name` field and a honeypot, and they submit normally. Netlify detects them at deploy time.

**Your own API.** Set `contactAction` to your endpoint URL. The form posts `name`, `company`, `email`, `phone`, `workflow` and `message`.

No API keys or credentials are included in the theme.

## Images

All photographs are local WebP files in `public/images/`. They were downloaded from [pxhere.com](https://pxhere.com) and resized and cropped for the theme. Every source page was checked at download time and states that the photo is released under **[CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)** (public domain), so you can redistribute it with the theme. Attribution is not required, but it is listed here for transparency.

The people in these stock photos are not connected to the fictional names used in the demo. `public/og-image.jpg` and `.github/preview.jpg` are composed from screenshots of the theme itself (which include `ai-agency-hero.webp`) plus the theme's own logo and typography.

**Replacing images.** Keep roughly the same aspect ratios (listed in each component's `width`/`height` attributes) and save as WebP for the best results. The theme applies its warm duotone filter through CSS, so any photo picks up the brand look.

## Fonts

| Font | Use | License | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outfit (variable) | Display / headings | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/fonts/outfit), [upstream](https://github.com/Outfitio/Outfit-Fonts) |
| Inter Tight (variable) | Body text | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/fonts/inter-tight), [upstream](https://github.com/rsms/inter) |

Both fonts are installed from npm and served from your own domain, so there are no requests to Google Fonts. The Latin subsets are preloaded. If a font fails to load, the stacks fall back to `system-ui`.

## SVG and icons

The theme uses its own SVG artwork from the original design. It does not use an icon library.

- **`src/components/icons/Logo.astro`** draws the ST AI Agency monogram. It has a `light` variant for the header and a `footer` variant.
- **`src/components/icons/icons.ts`** holds the icon set: clock, shield-check, bars, arrows, check, check-circle, plus, mail, phone, pin, time, LinkedIn, X, GitHub and RSS. Every icon draws with `currentColor`, so CSS controls its colour.
- **`src/components/icons/Icon.astro`** renders an icon: `<Icon name="check" size={16} />`. Icons are decorative (`aria-hidden`) unless you pass a `label`.

To add an icon, append an entry with `viewBox`, `size` and SVG `body` markup to `icons.ts`. The `IconName` type updates automatically.

## Deployment

The theme builds to static files in `dist/`, so it runs on any static host. Before you deploy, set your production URL. It is used for canonical tags, Open Graph, the sitemap and RSS:

- set the `SITE_URL` environment variable, for example `SITE_URL=https://www.example.com`, **or**
- change the default URL in `astro.config.mjs`.

### Vercel

Import the repository at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new). Vercel detects Astro automatically and uses `npm run build` with output directory `dist`. Add `SITE_URL` under *Settings → Environment Variables*.

### Netlify

Import the repository at [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com). Use build command `npm run build` and publish directory `dist`, and add `SITE_URL` as an environment variable. Set `forms.netlify: true` if you want Netlify Forms.

### Cloudflare Pages

Create a Pages project from your repository. Choose the **Astro** framework preset, or use build command `npm run build` and output directory `dist`. Set `SITE_URL`, and set `NODE_VERSION=22` if the default image uses an older Node.

### GitHub Pages and other static hosts

For GitHub Pages, use the official [withastro/action](https://github.com/withastro/action) workflow described in the [Astro GitHub Pages guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/). For a project site served from a sub-path, set both variables in the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  SITE_URL: https://<user>.github.io
  BASE_PATH: /st-ai-agency
```

Every internal link goes through the `url()` helper in `src/utils/url.ts`, so the theme works under that sub-path.

For any other host, run `npm run build` and upload the contents of `dist/`. Configure the host to serve `404.html` for missing pages.

## License
